## MILESTONE 03 AND 04 
In these milestones, we developed a dynamic resume builder that allows real-time data binding between form inputs and the resume preview. Users can enter their details, including name, email, phone, education, skills, and work experience, and see instant updates in the preview. Additionally, we made the resume fields editable directly in the preview using the contenteditable attribute, ensuring changes are reflected back in the form inputs. This seamless two-way data binding enhances user interaction and is implemented using TypeScript for type safety and reliability.
